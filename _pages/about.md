Welcome to my website! I am currently a first-year graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University. I graduated from Rutgers University with a double major in astrophysics (highest honors) and mathematics (honors) in May 2025. My primary areas of research (proposed) are hyperbolic partial differential equations and mathematical physics.
